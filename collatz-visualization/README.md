# Collatz Conjecture Visualization

This project is an interactive visual demonstration of the Collatz Conjecture. Enter any positive integer to see how the sequence evolves and how all numbers eventually reach 1.

## Features
- Input any starting number
- Visualize the Collatz sequence as a line graph
- See the full sequence and number of steps
- Responsive and modern UI

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a positive integer in the input box.
3. Click "Visualize" or press Enter to see the sequence.

## What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. For any positive integer:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- Repeat the process with the resulting number.

The conjecture states that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
